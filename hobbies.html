    <h1>Time Best Spent On</h1>
    <h2>Treasure Hunting</h2>

        <p>Jack Sparrow is always on the lookout for hidden treasures, whether it’s the cursed Aztec gold or the fabled Fountain of Youth. 
        His adventurous spirit and knack for finding (and losing) fortune keep him sailing across the seven seas.</p>
    
    <h2>Drinking Rum</h2>

    <p>No pirate’s life would be complete without a good bottle of rum. Jack enjoys sipping rum while contemplating his next move, 
        celebrating victories, or simply because he has a taste for it.</p>
    
    <h2>Outwitting Enemies</h2>

    <p>Jack is a master strategist, always coming up with clever and often ridiculous ways to escape danger. He enjoys tricking his 
        foes, from the British Royal Navy to rival pirates, and always finds a way to stay ahead.</p>

    <h2>Sailing the Open Seas</h2>

    <p>Nothing makes Jack feel more alive than being at the helm of his beloved ship, the Black Pearl. The freedom of the ocean, 
        the wind in his hair, and the call of adventure drive him forward.</p>
